the [harmony.css](./harmony.css) file is an old version of harmony i was using, i've tweaked and fixed a very small bit of stuff but that's about it

since the rewrite, i have also added a few of my own snippets, which i thought fit with harmony, they're under the lines with `//!`; so keep that in mind i guess
