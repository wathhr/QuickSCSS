I suggest using the "Better comments"/"Colored comments" extension
- [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments)
- [Sublime text](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Colored%20Comments)
- [Atom](https://github.com/AndrewKralovec/atom-better-comments)

In the case that you find some code "bad" or "ugly", I blame Sass for not everything.
