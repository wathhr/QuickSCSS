# Building

this should work i guess idk

```powershell
# WINDOWS ONLY

QuickSCSS> npm i

QuickSCSS> npm i sass@^1.35.2 postcss -g

QuickSCSS> npm run build       # for a Powercord build

QuickSCSS> npm run build-bd    # for a BetterDiscord build (discord canary recommended)

QuickSCSS> npm run build-web   # for a web build

QuickSCSS> npm run build-all   # for all supported build types
```
