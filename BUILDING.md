# Building

this should work i guess idk

i don't think this works for linux considering this is a batch script

```powershell
PS> git clone -b main --recurse-submodules https://github.com/wathhr/QuickSCSS QuickSCSS

PS> cd QuickSCSS

PS> npm i

PS> .\build                                # for a PowerCord build

PS> .\build bd                             # for a BetterDiscord build

PS> .\build web                            # for a web build
```
