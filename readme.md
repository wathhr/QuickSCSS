QuickSCSS [![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/wathhr/quickscss/badge/dev?s=5f2850cfa164e62ecf2eaa497b0a075cf28b67cf)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/wathhr/quickscss/overview/dev)

A customizable Discord theme, mainly for PowerCord.

QuickSCSS tries to work alongside other themes, while still looking nice with Discord's base design.

<sup>_This theme is meant to be used with the English UK locale, using a different locale might cause some issues._</sup>

## Credits
- Powercord's terrible Quick CSS.
  - Pretty much the only reason I made this is because of how bad powerCord's Quick CSS is.
  - It randomly wipes itself after Discord crashes.
  - No SCSS support.
