QuickSCSS [![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/wathhr/quickscss/badge/dev?s=5f2850cfa164e62ecf2eaa497b0a075cf28b67cf)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/wathhr/quickscss/overview/dev)

> âš  This branch is still a huge work-in-progress, a lot of things might be unfinished and/or broken.

A customizable Discord theme, mainly for [PowerCord](https://github.com/powercord-org/powercord).

QuickSCSS tries to work alongside other themes, while still looking nice with Discord's base design.

<sup>*This theme is intended to be used with the English UK locale, using a different locale might cause some issues.*</sup>

## Credits
- Powercord's terrible Quick CSS.
  - Pretty much the only reason I made this is because of how bad powerCord's Quick CSS is.
  - It randomly wipes itself after Discord crashes.
  - No SCSS support.

- [Hyblocker](https://github.com/hyblocker)
  - I Stole their [Space channels "snippet"](https://github.com/hyblocker/pixelcord/blob/59856ce1a9f7c59634101d5991f38c6e091a6063/src/app/qol/_space_channels.scss).
  - And probably a lot of other random stuff I forgot about.

- [NYRI4](https://github.com/NYRI4) & [Snapperito](https://github.com/Snapperito)
  - I stole their [Discolored theme](https://github.com/NYRI4/Discolored).

- [ClearVision team](https://github.com/ClearVision)
  - I stole their [Settings icons "snippet"](https://github.com/ClearVision/ClearVision-v6/blob/master/src/settings/icons.scss) idea.

- [Daniel Klingel](https://github.com/CorellanStoma)
  - I stole their [Context menu icons theme](https://github.com/CorellanStoma/Menu-Icons) idea.
